# DataAnalytics_Covid
R case study of effects of Covid vaccinations on excess death in England and Wales (UK) between September 2020 and August 2021. 

The Covid_Vaccination_Dataset_Workbench.thml is the html report of the Covid_Vaccination_Dataset_Workbench.Rmd which is an R Markdown script.

All data is present.

This is a case study for my Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.
